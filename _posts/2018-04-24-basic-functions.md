In todays blog post we are going to be actually starting this python course. We are going to learn how to use the `print` function and learn about some basic data type

### Print
The `print` function simply outputs text. For example
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
Will output
```
Hello World!
```

### Why the quotes?
The reason we use Inverted Commas is to tell Python that we our outputing a string or simply just raw text. If we were to print

```python
print("1+3")
```
It would output:

```
1+3
```

But if insted we were to print
```python
print(1+3)
```

It would output:

```
4
```
This is because the text is not seen as just text but as an `int` or integer, which is a whole number

### Data types
What we saw above is an example of two data types, but there are many which will be listed below

| Data Type     | Definition                              | Example        |
| ------------- |:---------------------------------------:|:--------------:|
| `str`         | Plain text                              | `"Hello World"`|
| `int`         | Whole Numbers                           | `10`           |
| `float`       | Numbers with a floating point (Decimals)| `4.2`          |

Those are some of the main ones that you will use as a beginner.


### Conclusion
You did it! You can now output text in a programming language! You can also tell the difference between certain data types! Next time we are going to be talking about one of the worlds most powerful calculators, Python.
