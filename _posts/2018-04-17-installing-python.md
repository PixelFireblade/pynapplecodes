### Installing
Go to <a href="https://python.org">Python.org</a> and hover over Downloads

### Which version?
We will be using 3.X because it is a newer version. If you want to use 2.X it won't make much of a difference, the fundamentals will be the same, but you will get some errors.



The rest is pretty self explanitory... 

### What is what?
There will be a few things on your computer if you are on Windows it will be in your root directory and on a mac it will usually be in a /usr folder (Ther will also be an app in applications)

There will be a few things that have installed, the one we want is IDLE.


### Customising IDLE
