<div class="message2">This blog is going to start as if you don't know how to program in the slightest, though you can join at anytime</div>


Welcome to Pynapple Codes, this blog will focus on python and maybe a bit on pineapples. This blog is aimed at people who don't have a clue what coding is or only have a basic knowledge on what coding is, in this blog post I will outline how my blog will work. 

<div class="message">(THIS WILL BE A SHORT POST DUE TO IT BEING THE FIRST ONE/I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO WRITE)</div>

### How the blog will work

Either once or twice a week I will post a python tutorial, I have already brainstormed over 30 topics on <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>.



<strong>Examples of Future Blog Posts</strong>

Random Function

Basic Tools

Maths in Python

### So why am I doing this

First of all I would like to thank <a target="_blank" href="https://booligoosh.github.io">Booligoosh</a>, someone who <strong>is an amazing coder (You can check him out on: <a href="https://github.com/Booligoosh" target="_blank">Github</a>).</strong> He inspired me to make this blog, check his blog out at <a target="_blank" href="https://codetheweb.blog">CodeTheWeb.blog</a>. But back to Pineapples,

<div class="message2">
    <h1>FUN FACT:</h1>
    <p>Pineapples eat you back (technically)</p>

But really, a huge thank you to Booligoosh

<strong>WHY I CHOSE THIS NAME?</strong>
<br>
I was actually talking with someone about a good name for a Python web blog, when I/They (I can't remember who chose it), thought of PYnapple, we laughed, but I couldn't think of an alternative so I chose it.
