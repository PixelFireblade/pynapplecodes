### What is Python?
Python is a programming language, that is used by many people.

### What kind of people?
Everyone from industry professionals, to beginners (I am guessing you are the latter as you are on this blog).

### Why would you use Python
That is kind of a stupid question, it can be used for many things, it isn't **constricted** by much, it can be used for maths, graphing and even games (but if you don't want to suffer, don't use it for that purpose)

Well there are tons but some well known ones are:

YouTube
Dropbox
Reddit
Google
